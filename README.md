## Chocolatey

![Chocolatey-logo](./assets/chocolatey-logo.svg)

Para um guia em portugu√™s de como usar o chocolatey para instalar suas depend√™ncias, basta acessar este [link](https://www.godela.com.br/noticia/1733/como-usar-o-chocolatey/).

This repository contains installation and update scripts, I use in my daily work.

They depend on üç´ [chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/), which is the package manager, I like most on Windows.

For the Linux SO, try üêß [https://github.com/georgemaia/env-linux](https://github.com/georgemaia/env-linux).

### Chocolatey install scripts

Chocolatey is a package manager for windows, allowing you to install apps with a single command. This is how you install git using chocolatey: ```choco install git```

See [github repo](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco)

---

### Usage

**First install Chocolatey using cmd**

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

After start `cmd.exe` as administrator and run [chocolatey-install.bat]chocolatey-install.bat).

You can simply switch from manual installation to chocolatey, because chocolatey uses the installers provided by the software vendors.
They should be capabale to recognize an existing installation.

---

### Documentation

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki)

Give `choco.exe /?` a shot (or `choco.exe -h`). For specific commands, add the command and then the help switch e.g. `choco.exe install -h`.

Check out [Chocolatey's homepage](https://chocolatey.org/) or this [github repo](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey).
